By now, you should have received an email from OptiRad, entitled ‘Confirmation Instructions’. This will provide you with the link you need to get started setting up a password for your account.

On the email, select *Click here to get started.*

Once you’ve set your password, you’ll be brought to OptiRad’s homepage and can start viewing the roster. Use your password to access OptiRad in the future.
