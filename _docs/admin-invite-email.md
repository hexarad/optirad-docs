If you received an email from Opitrad inviting you to the system and you are expecting this email, **welcome**, otherwise, consult your manager.

You have been sent an link which you can follow to https://optirad.hexarad.com/ domain where you set your password.

This can then be used (along with your email address) to sign into the Opitrad application.

If the link is somehow altered you not be able to set a password and you will presented with a message informing you the `Confirmation link is invalid`
