You can also integrate your OptiRad E-Roster with your outlook calendar. This will work at both the mobile and the desktop level. 

You will need to add a new 'internet calendar' > where you will be asked to paste a link provided to you by OptiRad as soon as you log in. 

Once added, you will need to add this new calendar to your outlook. Once added, you will have complete access to anything reflected across OptiRad on your outlook. Any changes made will be appropriately reflected for you as well.
