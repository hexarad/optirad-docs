You can enter into enter leave for each reporter directly from the roster (by clicking **+** within the Away row) or via the **Reporters** page, under **Network Level**. 

Simply select the user you want to add leave for, the type of leave, and the length of time off required. All leave will be immediately reflected in the E-Roster, automatically removing activities scheduled for that day so you don't have to.
