To add reporter leave, enter into 'Leave' which you can find associated with each individual reporter. 

Leave can be added or removed as required to reflect reporter availability. All leave will be immediately reflected in the E-Roster and override any job plan activities scheduled for that day. 

Type and length of leave can also be captured depending on individual circumstance.
