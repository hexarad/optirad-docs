The E-Roster provided by OptiRad will be bespoke to your department. It will be be driven by individual reporter profiles, job plans, leave and On-Call responsibilities, and defined by your departments work sessions. 

If the following inputs are accurate, the roster will transparently reflect departmental responsibilities as far in advance as possible. 

The generic roster will produce a 'birds eye' view of your department. However, there is a detailed filter feature that will allow you to tailor the roster as required to optimise its use.

## Roster Features

The roster has a number of easy to use features and a very detailed filter function which will optimise its use for you. 

The filter lives on the top left hand side of the roster. Once opened, you can filter the roster by date - both future and historic, by individual or multiple specific work sessions, by reporters working from home, in hospital, or those that are training, and you can also filter by individual or multiple reporters. You can similarly filter by study type - ultimately identifying a specific scan at the study level which needs to be reported or checked. The roster will then return all those reporters that are available and able to in fact report / check that scan. 

Next to the filter function in the top left hand corner, you also have an 'expand' feature. By clicking this, you can expand each individual roster entry to see the detail of each session. The sessions will then reflect the level of granularity in each individual job plan (e.g., type of reporting sessions, timing of session, whether they are working from home or on site etc.). This is a very useful feature once the roster has been filtered to your needs. 

Next to the expand arrows in the top left hand side of the roster is also a 'notes' icon. By pressing this, you can expand sessions to see any notes that administrators have left on the roster for all users to see. 

Lï»¿astly, any changes that are made to the roster by administrators will be reflected across your view as well. These changes will happen immediately (without you needing to refresh your session), reflecting a live and up-to-date representation of any departmental changes that occur.
