Once you have logged in, under Job plan > you will be able to view your individual job plan. 

Your job plan will have a simple weekly layout split into morning and afternoon sessions. Each component of the job plan is represented by an individual square and will include your 'Work Session' and associated activity (e.g., CT Thorax or MRI Neuro), which controls where this will be shown in your roster. The specificity of your job plan is configurable and can include as much information as desired. 

The different coloured squares amongst your job plan represent different activities. Grey represents supported professional activities (SPAs), green represents additional responsibilities (ADRs), and both red and blue represent direct clinical care activities. Within direct clinical care, OptiRad identifies both direct imaging activities (red - actual reporting time, such as CT or US reporting), as well as indirect imaging activities (Blue - non reporting time, such as MDTs). 

OptiRad will house your existing, as well as your historical job plans for you to view. However, only the most recent and 'active' job plan will be published on the E-Roster. 

You will be able to edit your job plan when ever required, however, only ad admin user can publish a new job plan for you. 

If you would like to edit your current job plan, you can simply duplicate your current job plan and action any necessary changes. When editing, you can either add or delete any necessary sessions or change anything from time, day, nature, or frequency of a session. Any changes that you make to your current job plan will then automatically save in the system. At this point, an admin user or a Hexarad support provider can publish the updated job plan as required. 

You can similarly choose to create an entirely new job plan. From here you can include all necessary sessions and activities. Again, this will save in the system and can be published by any admin user or Hexarad support provider.

* W﻿hen creating a new job plan, the mandatory fields include:\
  O﻿rganisation 
* W﻿ork session
* A﻿ctiity type
* T﻿ime
* Recurrence (Frequency of job plan component e.g.., weekly, bi-weekly)

OptiRad can capture as much detail as required t specify what is being done in each session. Reporters often do more than one thing a given session, for example in a CT Cold Reporting Sessions, one may spend 70% of their time doing General CT and the other 30% doing Thoracic CT work. Alternatively, your job plan can also capture 'general' reporting sessions if preferred.
