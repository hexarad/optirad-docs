You can access your roster once you log into OptiRad under > Roster. You will be provided with the default view of your individual weekly responsibilities. 

The roster is arranged with days along the top and your associated work sessions along the left hand side. Both leave and on-call can be seen at the bottom of the roster, and will remove you from any job planned activities during that time of necessary. 

## Roster features:

Your roster comes with a number of features that will optimise its use for you as required.

You can click on an individual job plan component to expand it and see the detail of that session. This will provide the activity (e.g., CT Thoracic, or Haem MDT), the time of the session, the location (if provided), and whether or not the session is from home or on site. You can also press the expand arrows in the top left hand side of the roster to expand all roster entries at once. 

The roster also comes with a comprehensive and easy to use filter option where you can manipulate it to your needs. By 'clearing' all filters, you will be able to view the roster for your entire department. This will include all reporters and their associated responsibilities for any given time period. 

* Optirad's filter feature allows you to filter by:
* Date (past and future)
* Organisation
* Work session / sessions
* Session's that are open to cold work allocation, working from home, working in hospital, or training sessions
* By study - this will output all reporters that are able to report that given study selected (e.g. for the report of an urgent scan or if a registrar needs a given scan checked)
* By individual or multiple reporters
