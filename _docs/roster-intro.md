Reporter Job Plans are radiology specific and will ultimately drive the transparency of the electronic roster whilst laying the framework for accurate and detailed capacity and demand forecasting across your department. 

Reporter Job Plans are split into morning and afternoon sessions. Each component of the Job Plan is represented by an individual square and will include a 'Work Session', which controls where it will live on the roster alongside its associated activity which provide more granular detail. 

The different colour squares reflect different activities. Grey represents supported professional activities (SPA). green represents additional responsibilities (ADR), and both red and blue represent direct clinical care activities. Within direct clinical care, OptiRad includes indirect imaging activities (IIAs )- non reporting time), and direct imaging activities (DIAs - reporting time). 

All 'published' job plans will remain saved in OptiRad, however, only the most recent one will be reflected across the roster.
