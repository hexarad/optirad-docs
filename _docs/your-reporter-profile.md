Once you have created your OptiRad account you will be able to see your reporter profile, job plan, and the Rota.

Under View profile > Associated skills is where you will be able to see your individual reporting responsibilities. We do ask that you check these and advise to your ourselves or your administration team of any changed need to be made. These can then be made as required.

OptiRad profiles reporters at the modality, sub-specialty, and study level. It will also capture the activity level at which you report a given sub-specialty. 

Profiling reporters at this level drives transparency over your reporting responsibilities and protects your reporting availability. 

Yï»¿ou are unable to edit your own profile, but as mentioned above, you can flag any necessary changes which will be actioned immediately. 

All available profiles options will live under 'Unassociated skills'. Here you can see the complete list of options that you may want to add to your profile.
