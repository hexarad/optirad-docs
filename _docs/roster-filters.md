You can refine the roster by using filters, which can be accessed by clicking **FILTERS** on the top left of the roster.

This will enable you to choose the date range that you want to view, allowing you to see multiple weeks at once or a date in the future. You can also use the checkboxes to refine how the roster looks for your individual workflow, showing only specific work sessions or colleagues if necessary.

Select the date range, work sessions, or reporters that you’d like to view, scroll to the bottom and click **Apply**. This will bring you back to the roster, now refined with the filters of your choice.



## Saving a Filter Pre-set

If you have a few different filter combinations that you might use regularly, you can save these so that they can be accessed quickly directly from the roster. Filter pre-sets are personal to you and will only be seen on your profile.

To use this feature, click **FILTERS** and enter combination of refinements that you’d like to save. For example, you might like to save an acute view roster that shows only Hot Reporting and MDTs. Choose these work sessions in the menu for your hospital.

Now, scroll to the bottom and select **Save filters**. You can name this filter pre-set whatever you’d like to before clicking save. These pre-sets are now saved and can be accessed from the dropdown menu at the top of the roster. You can remove a saved pre-set by selecting it and clicking the rubbish bin icon to the right of the menu.
