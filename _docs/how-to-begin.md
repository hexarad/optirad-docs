All reporters within your department will live under Network Level > Reporters. We refer to reporters in OptiRad because the ambition is that OptiRad can capture more than radiologists alone. OptiRad can include radiologists, registrars, radiographers, ultra-sonographers, and advanced practitioners. Although each may be from different departments, OptiRad can pull all of this information together into one simple system.

From the 'Reporter' page, you can navigate to individual reporter reporter job plans, leave, and On-Call.

OptiRad's electronic roster is driven by reporter profiles, reporter job plans, reporter leave, and On-Call. The following inputs drive roster transparency and accuracy, ensuring a live and up-to-date reflection of departmental responsibilities.

The default roster will represent responsibilities across the entire department. This is a 'Bird's Eye View', covering all available reporters and their job plans.
