Tï»¿he E-Roster provided by OptiRad will be bespoke to your department. It will be be driven by individual reporter profiles, job plans, leave and On-Call responsibilities, and defined by your departments work sessions. 

If the following inputs are accurate, the roster will transparently reflect departmental responsibilities as far in advance as possible. 

The generic roster will produce a 'birds eye' view of your department. However, there is a detailed filter feature that will allow you to tailor the roster as required to optimise its use.
