From the OptiRad homepage, you can access the roster for your organisation by clicking Roster, on the lefthand sidebar.

This will lead you to your personal roster, set as a default to show your work schedule and the entries that pertain to you. 

On the lefthand side of the roster, you will see a list of the work sessions at your organisation (for example, Hot Reporting). The roster is populated like a calendar, splitting each day by morning and afternoon.

The default view (above) will show the name of the individual in each activity and if they’re working in the morning or afternoon. If you’d like to see more specific detail, you can click on an entry in the roster or select Expand (highlighted in red) to open every entry.

Expanding the entries will show you more information about the session, as well as the exact time that it takes place. If your administrative team decides to include sites and room, this can also be shown by expanding the entry. Below you can see some examples of expanded entries.
