Unassigned entries are created when a job plan activity is overridden by newly created leave. 

Leave will automatically override job plan activities when created (no additional confirmation is required). Only when the job plan activity that is being overridden is for a work session that is marked as "important" will an unassigned entry be created. 

Any unassigned entries will be based upon the job plan activity the is being overridden. For example if the job plan activity is an ADR, the unassigned entry will also be an ADR.\
\
If leave is changed or removed any unassigned entries that were created as a result will be removed and added as required.

Once added to the roster, unassigned entries can be assigned to a reporter. To assign an unassigned entry, it means creating an adhoc roster entry that is based upon it. Once an unassigned entry as been assigned (has an adhoc roster entry associated) the unassigned entry will no longer appear on the roster.

Unassigned entries can also be removed from the roster by deleting them. Removing an unassigned entry will not remove any adhoc roster entry based upon it.
