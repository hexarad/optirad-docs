OptiRad is our market leading software solution to oversee, organise, and optimise - By combining workflow management alongside business intelligence OptiRad will make the most of your departments existing resources and streamline your radiology department. 

## How to navigate through OptiRad:

A﻿s a reporter, you will be able to view your individual reporter profile, your job plan, and the Rota. The default view of your Rota will reflect your individual responsibilities, however you can view the departmental Rota as well. 

Y﻿ou can synch your Rota to your Outlook Calendar as well. As such, you will be able to see your rostered activities through both your mobile and desktop outlook app.

## Y﻿our reporter profile:

Once you have created your OptiRad account you will be able to see your reporter profile, job plan, and the Rota.

On the left hand side, under View profile > Associated skills is where you will be able to see your individual reporting responsibilities. We do ask that you check these and advise to your ourselves or your administration team of any changed need to be made. These can then be made as required.

OptiRad profiles reporters at the modality, sub-specialty, and study level. It will also capture the activity level at which you report a given sub-specialty. 

Profiling reporters at this level drives transparency over your reporting responsibilities and protects your reporting availability. 

Y﻿ou are unable to edit your own profile, but as mentioned above, you can flag any necessary changes which will be actioned immediately. 

All available profiles options will live under 'Unassociated skills'. Here you can see the complete list of options that you may want to add to your profile.

## Y﻿our reporter job plan:

Once you have logged in, on the left hand side under Job plan > you will be able to view your individual job plan. 

Your job plan will have a simple weekly layout split into morning and afternoon sessions. Each component of the job plan is represented by an individual square and will include your 'Work Session' and associated activity (e.g., CT Thorax or MRI Neuro), which controls where this will be shown in your roster. The specificity of your job plan is configurable and can include as much information as desired. 

The different coloured squares amongst your job plan represent different activities. Grey represents supported professional activities (SPAs), green represents additional responsibilities (ADRs), and both red and blue represent direct clinical care activities. Within direct clinical care, OptiRad identifies both direct imaging activities (red - actual reporting time, such as CT or US reporting), as well as indirect imaging activities (Blue - non reporting time, such as MDTs). 

OptiRad will house your existing, as well as your historical job plans for you to view. However, only the most recent and 'active' job plan will be published on the E-Roster. 

You will be able to edit your job plan when ever required, however, only ad admin user can publish a new job plan for you. 

If you would like to edit your current job plan, you can simply duplicate your current job plan and action any necessary changes. When editing, you can either add or delete any necessary sessions or change anything from time, day, nature, or frequency of a session. Any changes that you make to your current job plan will then automatically save in the system. At this point, an admin user or a Hexarad support provider can publish the updated job plan as required. 

You can similarly choose to create an entirely new job plan. From here you can include all necessary sessions and activities. Again, this will save in the system and can be published by any admin user or Hexarad support provider.

* W﻿hen creating a new job plan, the mandatory fields include:\
  O﻿rganisation 
* W﻿ork session
* A﻿ctiity type
* T﻿ime
* Recurrence (Frequency of job plan component e.g.., weekly, bi-weekly)

OptiRad can capture as much detail as required t specify what is being done in each session. Reporters often do more than one thing a given session, for example in a CT Cold Reporting Sessions, one may spend 70% of their time doing General CT and the other 30% doing Thoracic CT work. Alternatively, your job plan can also capture 'general' reporting sessions if preferred.

## Y﻿our E-Roster:

You can access your roster once you log into OptiRad under > Roster. You will be provided with the default view of your individual weekly responsibilities. 

The roster is arranged with days along the top and your associated work sessions along the left hand side. Both leave and on-call can be seen at the bottom of the roster, and will remove you from any job planned activities during that time of necessary. 

## Roster features:

Your roster comes with a number of features that will optimise its use for you as required.

You can click on an individual job plan component to expand it and see the detail of that session. This will provide the activity (e.g., CT Thoracic, or Haem MDT), the time of the session, the location (if provided), and whether or not the session is from home or on site. You can also press the expand arrows in the top left hand side of the roster to expand all roster entries at once. 

The roster also comes with a comprehensive and easy to use filter option where you can manipulate it to your needs. By 'clearing' all filters, you will be able to view the roster for your entire department. This will include all reporters and their associated responsibilities for any given time period. 

* Optirad's filter feature allows you to filter by:
* Date (past and future)
* Organisation
* Work session / sessions
* Session's that are open to cold work allocation, working from home, working in hospital, or training sessions
* By study - this will output all reporters that are able to report that given study selected (e.g. for the report of an urgent scan or if a registrar needs a given scan checked)
* By individual or multiple reporters

## O﻿utlook Integration:

You can also integrate your OptiRad E-Roster with your outlook calendar. This will work at both the mobile and the desktop level. 

You will need to add a new 'internet calendar' > where you will be asked to paste a link provided to you by OptiRad as soon as you log in. 

Once added, you will need to add this new calendar to your outlook. Once added, you will have complete access to anything reflected across OptiRad on your outlook. Any changes made will be appropriately reflected for you as well.
