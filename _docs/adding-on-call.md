Oï»¿ptiRad captures reporter On-Call in an extremely useful way and can do so for as far in advance as possible. All reporter On-Call will also be kept in one place, making it very easy to manage. It will similarly be reflected directly on the E-Roster for all users to view.

OptiRad appreciated that different departments have varying On-Call requirements. As such, all On-Call sessions will be bespoke to your department. They can then be assigned to the appropriate reporter as required. 

Individual On-Call Rota's live next to each reporter, under 'On-Call'. Here you can add or remove any current or new responsibilities. Any changes made to reporter  On-Call will immediately reflect across the E-Roster. 

To change or add a new 'On-Call type, you can do this by following 'Org Level > On-call'. Alternatively, you can let us know any necessary changes that need to be made and the OptiRad Support Team will accommodate this for you.
