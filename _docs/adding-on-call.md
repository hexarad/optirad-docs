You can use OptiRad to manage your on call roster, as far in advance as necessary. On call sessions are bespoke to your department, and can be assigned to the appropriate reporter as required. 

You can change or add a new on call type via the **On Call** page, under **Org Level**. Each on call activity can be programmed with rules to remove the assigned reporter from the roster on the day before or after the session, depending on the need.
