To edit an existing job plan, duplicate the published entry. This will generate an exact copy of that job plan with editing abilities. From here, you can remove, add, or edit any activity as required. This can include changing the nature of the sessions, the time of the session, or the frequency of a session. 

Alternatively, you can create an entirely new job plan as well. This will fall under 'Blank Job Plan'. From here you can fill out the details as required.

When adding a new activity, the mandatory fields that you will need to fil out include:

* Organisation 
* Work session 
* A﻿ctivity Tye
* T﻿ime
* Recurrence (Frequency of job plan component e.g., weekly, bi-weekly)

O﻿ptiRad can capture all the required detail to specify what is being done in each session. Radiologists often do more than one type of reporting in any given session, for example a cold reporting session may consists of 50% MRI Head and Nech and 50% MRI Neuro. This can be accurately reflected in OptiRad. Alternatively, job plans can also capture 'general' reporting sessions if unable to identify that level of granularity. 

Once a job plan has been finalised and agreed, it can be published and will deploy live to the roster. You can select a specific publish date as well as required for individual reporters.
