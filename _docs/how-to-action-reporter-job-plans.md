To edit an existing job plan, duplicate the published entry from a reporter's **Job Plan** page (found on the **Reporters** page). This will generate an exact copy of that job plan that you can edit. From here, you can remove, add, or edit any activity as required. This can include changing the nature of the sessions, the time of the session, or the frequency of a session. 

Alternatively, you can create an entirely new job plan by clicking **Blank Job Plan**. When adding a new activity, the mandatory fields that you will need to fill out include:

* Organisation 
* Work session 
* Activity Type
* Time
* Recurrence (frequency of job plan component e.g., weekly, bi-weekly)

Oï»¿ptiRad can capture all the required detail to specify what is being done in each session. If a radiologist is doing  more than one type of reporting in any given session, this can be accurately reflected in OptiRad by adding more elements in the DIA menu. Alternatively, job plans can also capture 'general' reporting sessions if you're unable to identify that level of granularity. 

Once a job plan has been finalised and agreed, it can be published and will deploy live to the roster. You can select a specific publish date as well as required for individual reporters.
