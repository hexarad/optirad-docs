The roster has a number of easy to use features which will optimise its use for you. 

By clicking on an individual roster entry, you can expand to view the detail within each session. You can similarly expand all sessions at once by clicking the expand arrows - these live in the top left hand corner of the roster, above all work sessions. 

Once a session is expanded, under 'Actions' you have the option to edit or delete that session directly at the roster level to accommodate any last minute changes such as potential shift swaps or sick leave. When editing a session, you can change the responsible reporter, nature of the session, time of the session, or day of the session. Any changes made to an activity at the roster level will not impact underlying job plans. They will be one-off changes made directly at the roster level. You can also navigate to that individual reporters profile, job plan, leave or on-call from here if any changes need to be made to those inputs. 

Next to the expand arrows in the top left hand side of the roster is also a 'notes' icon. By pressing this, you can expand sessions to add any notes which all users will then be able to see. This can be used as needed, depending on departmental requirements, for example to add in ad-hoc audit meetings or reasons for shift swaps. 

The roster also comes with a very detailed filter function. The filter lives on the top left hand side of the roster as well. Once opened, you can filter the roster by date - both future and historic, by individual or multiple specific work sessions, by reporters working from home, in hospital, or those that are training, and you can also filter by individual or multiple reporters. You can similarly filter by study type - ultimately identifying a specific scan at the study level which needs to be reported or checked. The roster will then return all those reporters that are available and able to in fact report / check that scan. 

Lastly, the roster also has an 'unassigned activity' feature, which can be used to populate the E-Roster with regular activities that do not have a regular assigned individual. Unassigned activities allow you to easily identify unfilled gaps in the E-Roster (e.g., alternating reporting sessions or MDTs) and allow you to assign individuals that have the correct skills to cover specified activities. This feature can be used for both clinical shifts as well as meetings. You can simply create an 'Unassigned Activity' in OptiRad, capturing the nature of the activity, the day, the time, and the recurrence. Once saved, this will be reflected across the E-Roster as expected and can be assigned to a reporter at any point.
